# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a digital product such as a website or mobile application. It outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a user interface without focusing on design details like colors, images, or typography. Wireframes serve as a bridge between an idea and the final design, helping to visualize the user journey and overall flow of the product.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process because it:

- **Clarifies Structure**: Provides a clear overview of page layouts and navigation flow.  
- **Saves Time and Cost**: Helps identify potential issues early before development begins.  
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Focuses on User Experience (UX)**: Ensures usability and logical placement of elements before visual design is applied.  

By focusing on the “skeleton” of a product, wireframing ensures a strong foundation for creating user-friendly, functional, and aesthetically appealing designs.


## Key Elements of a Wireframe

1. **Layout Structure**  
   Defines the overall arrangement of sections on a page (e.g., header, body, sidebar, and footer).  
   *Example:* A homepage might have a header at the top for branding, a main body for content, and a footer for contact details. This helps ensure consistency and clarity in design.  

2. **Navigation**  
   Represents how users move between different pages or sections of the product. This often includes menus, links, or buttons.  
   *Example:* A navigation bar with links to *Home*, *About*, and *Contact* ensures users can easily explore the site without confusion.  

3. **Content Placement**  
   Refers to where text, images, and multimedia elements will appear. It ensures that important information is prioritized and visible.  
   *Example:* Placing a call-to-action button like *“Sign Up”* at the top of a landing page draws immediate user attention and increases engagement.  

4. **Functionality**  
   Shows how interactive elements (buttons, forms, sliders, etc.) will behave within the interface.  
   *Example:* A login form with input fields for *username* and *password* demonstrates where users enter data and how they access personalized content.  

These elements work together to provide clarity, guide user behavior, and establish a foundation for effective and efficient product design.


## Types of Wireframes

1. **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   - **Description:** Simple sketches or digital outlines with basic shapes and placeholders. They avoid design details and focus only on structure and functionality.  
   - **When to Use:** Early in the design process to brainstorm ideas, validate layouts, and gather quick feedback without worrying about aesthetics.  
   - **Example:** Boxes for images, lines for text, and rough placement of buttons.  

2. **High-Fidelity Wireframes**  
   - **Description:** Detailed representations that include actual text, images, typography, and sometimes interactive elements. They closely resemble the final product design.  
   - **When to Use:** Later in the design process to refine details, test usability, and share with stakeholders or developers before moving into prototyping.  
   - **Example:** Screens with realistic content, styled buttons, navigation menus, and forms.

## Wireframe Example

![Wireframe Exmaple](wireframe_example.png)

The attached image represents a **High-Fidelity Wireframe**.  
It includes detailed mobile app screens such as splash, sign-in, login, home feed, detailed listings, and reservation pages. These wireframes go beyond simple layouts — they showcase real text, structured content, icons, and functional buttons, making them closer to the final product.  

This type of wireframe is typically used to:  
- Communicate the full user flow across multiple screens.  
- Demonstrate interactions like signing in, joining, browsing listings, and making reservations.  
- Test usability and gather feedback from stakeholders or potential users before moving into development.
