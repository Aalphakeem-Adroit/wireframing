# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a digital product such as a website or mobile application. It outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a user interface without focusing on design details like colors, images, or typography. Wireframes serve as a bridge between an idea and the final design, helping to visualize the user journey and overall flow of the product.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process because it:

- **Clarifies Structure**: Provides a clear overview of page layouts and navigation flow.  
- **Saves Time and Cost**: Helps identify potential issues early before development begins.  
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, and stakeholders.  
- **Focuses on User Experience (UX)**: Ensures usability and logical placement of elements before visual design is applied.  

By focusing on the “skeleton” of a product, wireframing ensures a strong foundation for creating user-friendly, functional, and aesthetically appealing designs.
